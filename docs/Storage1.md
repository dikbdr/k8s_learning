# Ephemeral Volumes in Kubernetes

Ephemeral volumes are temporary storage resources in Kubernetes that exist only for the lifetime of a pod. When the pod is deleted, the data in these volumes is lost. They are ideal for use cases where data persistence is not required.

## Types of Ephemeral Volumes

### 1. **emptyDir**

- **Description:**  
    An `emptyDir` volume is created when a pod is assigned to a node and exists as long as the pod runs on that node. The volume is initially empty and can be used by all containers in the pod.
- **Use Cases:**  
    - Temporary scratch space for processing data.
    - Sharing files between containers in a pod.
    - Caching intermediate data.

### 2. **configMap & secret**

- **Description:**  
    These volumes provide pod access to configuration data (`configMap`) or sensitive information (`secret`). The data is mounted as files inside the pod.
- **Use Cases:**  
    - Injecting configuration files.
    - Providing credentials or API keys securely.

### 3. **downwardAPI**

- **Description:**  
    Exposes pod and container metadata to applications via files.
- **Use Cases:**  
    - Accessing pod labels, annotations, or resource limits from within the container.

### 4. **ephemeral (Generic Ephemeral Volumes)**

- **Description:**  
    Introduced in Kubernetes 1.16+, allows dynamic provisioning of ephemeral storage using existing storage drivers (CSI).
- **Use Cases:**  
    - Temporary storage with advanced features (e.g., encryption, snapshots) provided by CSI drivers.

---

### 5. **Projected Volumes**

- **Description:**  
    Combines multiple volume sources (like secrets, configMaps, downwardAPI) into a single volume.
- **Use Cases:**  
    - Consolidating multiple sources into one mount point for easier management.

**Note:**  
Ephemeral volumes are not suitable for storing data that must persist beyond the pod's lifecycle. For persistent storage, use Persistent Volumes (PVs).
